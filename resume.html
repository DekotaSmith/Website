        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p>After earning my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I started working as a Junior Web Developer at XYZ Technologies in June 2023. In this role, I helped build and maintain websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which gave me practical experience in web development.</p>

        <p>I worked closely with other team members, like designers and backend developers, to add new features and fix any issues. This teamwork helped me learn how front-end and back-end development work together to create a smooth user experience.</p>

        <p>Part of my job also involved improving website performance to make sure pages loaded quickly and worked well for users. I participated in user testing, using feedback to make improvements to the website.</p>

        <p>I also used Git, a tool for tracking and managing code changes, to collaborate with my team and keep our work organized. This experience helped me apply the skills I learned during my degree and improved my ability to contribute to web development projects.</p>
